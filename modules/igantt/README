IGANTT MODULE

 	iGantt dotproject module : this module should be used as an add-on module of dotProject Project Management Software (see
	www.dotproject.net for details). It provides an interactive Gantt chart display. Interactive means that the chart can be
	modified graphically and the result can be sent back to dotproject for updating tasks. This work has been tested with 
	Mozilla Firefox v3.0.5 and Opera v9.63.

	This module DOES NOT work with INTERNET EXPLORER (and it is not intended to do so in the foreseeable future).

INSTALLATION
	
	This module is an add-on module of dotProject. Please refer to the add-on module installation instruction
	in the dotProject documentation <http://docs.dotproject.net/index.php?title=Add_On_Installation>.
	
	The AJAX library should be copied under /lib directory. The wz_jsgraphics library is provided under the js directory
	in the igantt module directory.
	
	The iGantt module is given as a 'utility' add-on module (available in dotProject v1.2.1). If you are running dP v1.2.1;
	the module will show in the module menu, but only as a tab in the project view. For previous version of dP, the module 
	will show in the module menu bar.
	
	Users should be given at least read allow permission to the iGantt module. Other permissions are not checked. On the 
	other hand, the module checks access permission to companies, projects and individual tasks. These permissions are applied
	to display the Gantt chart and to allow/deny task modification.
	
	For technical reasons, the Gantt chart is displayed in a pop-up window. Make sure that you allow pop-ups in your browser.
	
USER GUIDELINES

	To display a project Gantt chart, click on the Igantt tab in the project view. The Gantt will display in a resizable
	fullscreen pop-up window with scroll bars.
	
	The user can select the timespan of the graph. By default, the "show full project" option is selected. The user can:
	1.	select specific start/end date for the scale using the date fields.
	2.	show the current month by clicking the corresponding link
	3.	use the left (resp. right) arrows to scroll the current graph dates by one month backward (resp. forward).
	
	Tasks are displayed in hierarchical order. By clicking on the collapse icon, the user can hide the children tasks of the
	corresponding parent task. The whole display is updated according to the collapse/expand options selected for each task.
	
	To change task start/end date, click on the bar and drag it (only horizontally) to the right position. The following
	rules apply:
	1.	One cannot modify a completed task (shown as a grey bar in the chart) start/end dates.
	2.	One cannot modify the start date of a started task.
	3.	If one clicks on the left end of the bar, only the start date will be modified; on the other hand, if one clicks
		on the right end of the bar, only the end date will be modified; hence, in both cases, the time span of the task 
		will be changed. However, the task duration will not be changed in the dP database when updating (task duration is
		considered as a workload for the task). Otherwise, both the end date and the start date will be modified and the 
		time span of the task will not change.
		Note : the cursor shape should change depending on which part of the bar you are hovering. But this function does not seem
		to work with Opera.
	4.	For during dragging, an overlay is displayed to indicate the changing dates/hours. This display uses the user 
		preference date/hour format as set in dP.
	5.	When dragging a task bar, the dependy drawings are hidden and two grey horizontal lines are displayed above and below
		the dragged bar. These lines show the time limit of the required (resp. dependent) tasks. No constraints are applied
		to the dragging and the required/dependent tasks will not be modified. Only if "track dependent tasks" is set under 
		"dependency tracking" in dP, these dates will be modified when updating tasks in the dP database (see below).
	
	Detailed information on a task can be displayed and updated (depending on task edit user permission) using a right click
	( left click with Ctrl key pressed when using Opera) on the bar. The detailed information is shown in an overlay close to the bar.
	Task start/end date updates are restricted for dynamic tasks and already started tasks in order to maintain consistency.
	
	One can create new dependencies graphically. To do this, click on the required task bar while pressing the Alt key (the selected
	bar is displayed in red). Then, click on the dependent task bar (no other interaction should take place in between) and the
	new dependency will be displayed.
	
	At any time, the "undo" button can be used to undo the previous actions (starting from the latest action), up to the original
	graph.
	
	The "cancel" button at the bottom left of the chart closes the pop-up window without updating tasks.
	
	When the chart is updated, click on the "submit" button at the bottom right of the chart. The tasks start/end dates and
	dependencies will be updated in the dP database and dependency constraints will apply, if appropriately set. After updating,
	the project view returns to the tasks tab.
